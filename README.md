#COSMOS OS x64 Version

Here we are re-creating Comos OS as an x64 version as Cosmos OS written in x86 is a great tool for creating Operating Systems with it is highly outdated as it does not allow you to create an x64 Operating System which is the type of computer that we are all using.

Please help us re-create Cosmos Os as an x64 tool.
